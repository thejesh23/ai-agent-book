# GAIA Experience Learning System

> Corresponds to Chapter 8 · Experiment 8-1 ★★ "Learning from Successful Experiences: Strategy Summarization" in *Deep Understanding of AI Agents*.
> This directory contains the top-level wrapper script for the experiment; `AWorld/` is a copy of the upstream framework — do not modify.

A modified version of AWorld that adds learning from experience capabilities for the GAIA benchmark. This system can capture successful task trajectories, summarize them into reusable experiences, and apply learned knowledge to improve performance on new tasks.

**Experiment highlights (why this matters)**: GAIA is a high-difficulty benchmark requiring multi-step reasoning and integrated use of browser/file/code interpreter tools.
This experiment demonstrates a "learn-apply" loop — each time an agent successfully solves a task, its trajectory is distilled into an experience and stored in a knowledge base. When encountering a new task, similar experiences are retrieved and injected into the prompt.
The hypothesis is: **Reusing accumulated experience improves GAIA performance**. Using `--compare`, you can run an A/B comparison on the same set of tasks to empirically test this hypothesis (see [A/B Comparison Experiment](#-ab-comparison-experimentreproduce-the-experiments-point) below).

## 🌟 Features

### 1. **Learning from Experience**
- Captures the **actual execution trajectory** produced by AWorld (read back from
  `TaskResponse.trajectory`) when a task completes successfully
- Uses LLM to summarize trajectories into natural language experiences
- Stores learned experiences (approach, key insights, tools, step count) for future reference

### 2. **Knowledge Base with Semantic Search**
- Indexes the `gaia-validation.jsonl` file for preloaded experiences
- Uses sentence embeddings for semantic similarity search
- Supports both semantic and keyword-based retrieval

### 3. **Experience Application**
- Retrieves relevant past experiences for new queries
- Enhances system prompts with relevant experiences
- Improves task performance by leveraging past successes

## 💡 Usage

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Run with Learning Mode
Capture and learn from successful trajectories:
```bash
python run_with_experience.py \
    --learning-mode \
    --start 0 --end 5 \
    --split validation
```

#### 2. Run with Experience Application
Apply learned experiences to new tasks:
```bash
python run_with_experience.py \
    --apply-experience \
    --preload-kb \
    --start 5 --end 10 \
    --split validation
```

#### 3. Combined Mode
Learn and apply experiences simultaneously:
```bash
python run_with_experience.py \
    --learning-mode \
    --apply-experience \
    --preload-kb \
    --start 0 --end 10
```

#### 4. A/B Comparison Mode
Evaluate the same tasks twice — once without experience, once with — and report the delta:
```bash
python run_with_experience.py --compare --start 10 --end 20 \
    --experience-db ./learned_experiences.json
```
See [A/B Comparison Experiment](#-ab-comparison-experimentreproduce-the-experiments-point) for the full workflow.

## 🔧 Configuration

The `config.yaml` file provides detailed configuration options:

### Key Configuration Sections:1. **Learning Settings**
   - Summarizer model and temperature
   - Experience storage settings
   - Maximum trajectory steps

2. **Knowledge Base Settings**
   - Embedding model configuration
   - Search parameters (top-k, similarity threshold)
   - Index storage path

3. **Application Settings**
   - Experience incorporation strategy
   - Filtering criteria (by level, tools, recency)
   - Maximum experiences in prompt

## 📊 How It Works

### Learning Process

1. **Trajectory Capture**: After a task runs, the actual step-by-step trajectory (tools, actions, params) is read back from AWorld's `TaskResponse.trajectory` and normalized for the summarizer
2. **Success Detection**: When a task completes successfully, the trajectory is marked for learning
3. **Summarization**: The trajectory is analyzed by an LLM to extract:
   - High-level approach
   - Key insights and patterns
   - Tools used effectively
   - Generalizable strategies
4. **Storage**: The summarized experience is stored with the original question for retrieval

### Retrieval and Application

1. **Query Analysis**: New questions are analyzed for similarity to past experiences
2. **Semantic Search**: The knowledge base finds relevant experiences using embeddings
3. **Experience Selection**: Top-k most relevant experiences are selected
4. **Prompt Enhancement**: Selected experiences are formatted and added to the system prompt
5. **Execution**: The agent solves the task with the benefit of past experiences

### Knowledge Base Preloading

The system can preload the `gaia-validation.jsonl` file to bootstrap the knowledge base:
- Each entry is parsed for question, approach, and tools used
- Experiences are indexed using sentence embeddings
- Enables immediate access to a rich set of problem-solving patterns

## 📈 Performance Benefits

1. **Improved Success Rate**: Agents learn from past successes to avoid repeating mistakes
2. **Faster Problem Solving**: Relevant experiences guide the agent to efficient solutions
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Experiences from similar problems apply to new challenges
4. **Reduced Token Usage**: Past insights can reduce exploration and trial-and-error

## 🧪 A/B Controlled Experiment (reproduce the experiment's point)

The core hypothesis of this experiment is that **reusing accumulated experience improves GAIA scores**. The `--compare` mode turns this hypothesis into a runnable, reproducible controlled experiment: it runs the same set of questions twice—once with experience reuse **disabled** (baseline) and once with experience reuse **enabled** (with-experience)—and reports the difference in accuracy (delta) between the two.

**Recommended workflow (to avoid data leakage):** First accumulate experience on one batch of questions, then run the comparison on a **different, unseen batch** of questions. Directly using `--preload-kb` on the evaluation questions will inject the reference solutions from `gaia-validation.jsonl` into the knowledge base, which is equivalent to leaking the answers; the script will print a warning if it detects this situation.

```bash
# 1) Accumulate experience on questions 0-10 (learn only from successful trajectories)
python run_with_experience.py --learning-mode --start 0 --end 10

# 2) Run A/B comparison on questions 10-20 (unseen), reusing the experience learned in step 1
python run_with_experience.py --compare --start 10 --end 20 \
    --experience-db ./learned_experiences.json
#     Or: ./run.sh learn --start 0 --end 10 && ./run.sh compare --start 10 --end 20
```

**Output:** The console prints the following summary, while also writing per-question details to `comparison_results.json` (or a path specified by `--output`):

```
============================================================
A/B COMPARISON: experience reuse vs. baseline
============================================================
  Tasks evaluated       : <N>  (split=validation, range=[10, 20))
  Reusable experiences  : <M> learned, <K> preloaded
  Baseline accuracy     : <c1>/<N> = <p1>%
  With-experience acc.  : <c2>/<N> = <p2>%
  Delta (with - base)   : <p2 - p1>%
============================================================
```

**Expected results:** When the experience database contains transferable experiences relevant to the evaluation questions, the accuracy with experience should be **≥** the baseline, and the delta should be positive—this is the gain from the "learn-apply loop". All numbers are computed by `question_scorer` from actual run results; the script does not hardcode any scores. If the experience database is empty or the experiences are irrelevant, the delta may be 0, which is normal (indicating no reusable relevant experience is available yet).

> ⚠️ Running the full comparison requires: a usable LLAPI (`LLM_API_KEY` etc. in `.env`), an installed AWorld (`pip install -e ./AWorld`), the `sentence-transformers` / `faiss-cpu` dependencies, and the GAIA dataset (`GAIA_DATASET_PATH`). If you only want to verify that the command line works, you can run `python run_with_experience.py --help` without the above environment.

## 🔍 Example Experience

```json
{
  "question": "Find AI regulation paper from June 2022 on arXiv",
  "answer": "egalitarian",
  "summary": "Successfully located paper by using advanced search with date filters",
  "approach": "Web search → Navigate to arXiv → Use advanced search → Filter by date",
  "tools_used": ["web_search", "browser_navigate", "browser_click"],
  "key_insights": [
    "Advanced search provides better filtering options",
    "Date range queries need specific format",
    "Multiple searches refined the query"
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Extending the System

### Adding Custom Summarizers
Create a new summarizer by extending `TrajectorySummarizer`:
```python
class CustomSummarizer(TrajectorySummarizer):
    def _create_summary_prompt(self, question, answer, trajectory):
        # Custom prompt logic
        pass
```

### Custom Experience Filters
Add filtering logic in `ExperienceAgent._get_relevant_experiences()`:
```python
def filter_by_custom_criteria(experiences):
    # Custom filtering logic
    return filtered_experiences
```

### Alternative Embedding Models
Change the embedding model in configuration:
```yaml
knowledge_base:
  index:
    embedding_model: "all-mpnet-base-v2"  # Higher quality embeddings
    embedding_dim: 768  # Adjust dimension accordingly
```

## 📝 Notes

- The system requires API access to an LLM for summarization
- Embedding models are downloaded on first use (may take time)
- Knowledge base indexing is incremental and persistent
- Experiences are saved after each successful task
