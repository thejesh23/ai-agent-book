### 👤 You

In the agentic-rag project, add a script to chunk and index all laws in @https://github.com/ZixinxinWang/Legal-Eagle-InternLM/tree/main/Retrieval-Augmented%20Generation/laws 

In the contextual-retrieval project, also add a script to chunk and index all laws in it, using contextual retrieval.

In both projects, do NOT chunk each paragraph as a chunk. You should set a character soft limit (e.g., 4096 characters) and a hard limit (e.g., 8192 characters) and be aware of paragraph boundaries when chunking (accumulate until exceeding the soft limit, but cut off a paragraph if the hard limit is reached).

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I'll create scripts for both the `agentic-rag` and `contextual-retrieval` projects to chunk and index legal documents from the specified repository. Let me first examine the existing structure of both projects to understand their implementation patterns.

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Now I'll create scripts for both projects to download, chunk, and index the legal documents. Let me start with the `agentic-rag` project first.

### 👤 You

Do NOT use a crawler. The laws folder is already present locally. You should first clean up existing indexes before creating the new index.

agentic-rag % ls laws
1-宪法	2-宪法相关法  3-民法典	3-民法商法  4-行政法  5-经济法	6-社会法  7-刑法  8-诉讼与非诉讼程序法

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

I see the laws are already available locally. Let me create scripts for both projects that will:
1. Clean up existing indexes first
2. Read the local legal documents from the laws directory
3. Apply smart chunking with proper paragraph boundaries
4. Index them appropriately

Let me start with the `agentic-rag` project:

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Now let me create the script for the `contextual-retrieval` project that uses contextual chunking:

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Let me check if the laws directory exists in the contextual-retrieval project and create a symlink if needed:

---

### 🤖 Cursor Assistant

Now let me create documentation for both scripts:

## ✅ Completed: Legal Document Indexing Scripts

I've created two comprehensive scripts for chunking and indexing the local legal documents (288 files across 9 categories):

### 1. **Agentic-RAG Project** (`index_local_laws.py`)
- Standard chunking with smart paragraph boundaries
- Soft limit: 4096 characters, Hard limit: 8192 characters  
- Cleans existing indexes before processing
- Category-based organization
- Progress tracking and verification tests

### 2. **Contextual-Retrieval Project** (`index_local_laws_contextual.py`)
- Implements Anthropic's Contextual Retrieval approach
- Generates LLM-based context for each chunk
- Significantly improves retrieval accuracy
- Includes caching to reduce API costs
- Comparison mode to test with/without context

## Key Features

Both scripts implement:
- **Smart Chunking Strategy**: Accumulates paragraphs until the soft limit is reached, respects boundaries up to the hard limit
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Clears existing indexes before processing
- **Category Support**: Process all or specific legal categories
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time updates with detailed statistics
- **Verification Tests**: Built-in search queries to validate indexing

## Usage Examples

**Agentic-RAG (Standard):**
```bash
# Index all documents
python index_local_laws.py

# Index specific categories with verification
python index_local_laws.py --categories "宪法" "民法典" --verify
```

**Contextual-Retrieval (Enhanced):**
```bash
# Index with contextual enhancement
python index_local_laws_contextual.py --compare

# Compare with non-contextual mode
python index_local_laws_contextual.py --no-contextual --compare
```

## Documentation

Created comprehensive README files for both scripts:
- `agentic-rag/README_LEGAL_INDEXING.md`
- `contextual-retrieval/README_LEGAL_INDEXING.md`

The contextual-retrieval version includes a detailed explanation of the context generation process, cost estimation, and performance optimization strategies.

The scripts are ready to use with the existing 288 legal documents in the `laws` directory, properly organized by category (宪法, 民法典, 刑法, etc.).
